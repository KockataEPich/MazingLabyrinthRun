Retrospect
------------------------
- The scope of the project has been decided. The scope is as follows:
	- Maze:
		- Tile based maze game in which a person controls a moving entity
		- Mazes will be procedurely generated from a seed and will have non-linear shape ( Meaning they are not just a square/rectangle )
		- Mazes wll have timer which will indicate performance. 
		- Maze runs will be saved on each profile
	- Profile
		- Simple account system with email/password. Will include email confirmation.
	- The project scope will be kept very simple. If the baseline has been achieved, there are a few improvements that could be made:
		- Special tiles, item system and multiplayer are all being considered.
		
- Reading/Education about given topics is going at a steady pace.
- Diagram for project was not done but software was looked for.
