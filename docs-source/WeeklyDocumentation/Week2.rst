.. _week-2:

29/November/2021
==============================================

Retrospect
------------------------
- The project still needs to be setup with the backend and front end starter.
- The technology choise from the previous week has been approved for the following reasons:
	- **ReactJS** - compact front-end framework that is very popular and relatively straightforward
	- **JavaSpring** - framework that I have experience with and also with the language Java itself.
	- **MySQL** - Effective database solution. While scalability might be a problem with SQL databases, here it shouldn't make a big
	  impact since the application will be and probably stay relatively simple. If complications start arising, a switch to a different
	  database will be considered.
	  
- Documenting the project with shpinx feels like the right choice. The aesthethic of the webpage may change depending on the color scheme of the application.

Week Plan
------------------------
This week, the front-end and back-end should be put on github. Because both ReactJS and JavaSpring
have starters, this shouldn't take too long. Also, research should continue

Research Points
-----------------
	1. Scope of the project (i.e what should it actually include).
	2. Components of the project.
	3. Interaction between different components.
	4. What should be done on the front-end and what on the back-end.
