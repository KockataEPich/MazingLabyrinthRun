.. _week-6:

29/December/2021
==============================================

Retrospect
------------------------
- Holidays Yay! Probably Not much work will be done this week.
- Book about design patterns is finished
- Learning Spring overall will take time.
- It seems like the most sensible approach is to start working & having fun. I tried
looking and researching into JavaSpring and React broadly has been detremental. I fear
I have a dose of "analysis paralysis". Unless I am having fun I will have no motivation 
to work on this project.

Week Plan
------------------------
- Have fun on the Holiday more importantly
- Make some basic JavaSpring controller

Research Points
-----------------
	1. React and browser code integrity in general
	2. Java Containers
