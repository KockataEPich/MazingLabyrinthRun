Week 7
==============================================

Date: 11/January/2022

Retrospect
------------------------
- The week before this one was skipped because of holidays.
- While thinking about the JavaSpring controller, I realised that it would be much better to start on the front-end and adapt the back-end to it. 

Week Plan
------------------------
- The main goal for this and next week is to have a basic maze generator on the front end.
- It will be very simple. A textbox in which a number from 0-9 is inputted and then a maze is generated according to that number.
- It will be made with simple squares of two types, walls and walkable path.

Research Points
-----------------
	1. React and browser code integrity in general
	2. Java Containers
	3. Procedural generation
