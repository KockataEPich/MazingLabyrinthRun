==============================================

Retrospect
------------------------
- There was a lot of travelling last week as well, so not much work was done.
- I decided to take the project in a different direction. I was thinking that since I am working with c++ and it is the primary language games are written, it would beI am working with c++ and it is the primary language games are written, it would bemore feasible to make a c++ desktop game. The online account aspect will still be there, it is just going to be a local game, rather than a browser one. I believe not only does this make more sense for me, but also it will allow me a better creativity and wider scope.
- I did research about it and found that the 2dcocos library might be a good fit for the game.
- It is possible to have a separate client which manages the remote things. I am not really sure right now if this is a good idea. Basically, the client will communicate with the remote server and start the game for the user. Kind of like League of Legends (although I am not really familiar with the inner designs, this is what I have in mind). This will probably require a sync functionality since, unlike League of Legends, I would like my game to be playable offlne.
- The React things will stil be useful. I plan on creating a website for the game, which users can manage their accounts.
- Maybe I could expand it to forums as well.

Week Plan
------------------------
- Setup the cocos library with the working environment

Research Points
-----------------
	1. React and browser code integrity in general
	2. Java Containers
	3. Procedural generation
	4. Cocos documentation
	5. Electron (for the client)
