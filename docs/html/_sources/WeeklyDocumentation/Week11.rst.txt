==============================================

Retrospect
------------------------
- My consistency in upkeeping these docs has not been that great. Partly because the project is in such an early stage that so many things change.

- I am now back to SFML. Unfortunatelly every other game engine is just way too unfun to start with. I have to fight with layers and layers of complexity and I realised that if I am to do that, I will never actually work on the project, since it is very important that I am enjoying the work.

- I have managed to setup SFML with CMake. Although it is very low level, it really fits my desires very well. 

Week Plan
------------------------
- Setup testing
- Create a basic tilemap layout

Research Points
-----------------
	1. React and browser code integrity in general
	2. Java Containers
	3. Procedural generation
	4. Electron (for the client)
	5. Tile based system
