==============================================


Retrospect
------------------------
- Weeee, it has been a very while! Even though I didn't work on the project recently, I had a great summer!
- I am weirdly enthusiastic about this project again all of a sudden. I guess pushing it has never been the solution
- One reason which kept me from getting into it again was that I had forgot what was happening in the codebase and it looked like a mess. I need to find some way of informing my future self
- Yes, I gave up calling it "Weekly updates" since my last update was 5 months ago and who knows when the next one will be. 

- The code is now much more generic. 
- I have dramatically improved the handling of the animations and actions which are the big highlights of the recent work. Almost all other parts have been improved in some way though.


- I ditched the sub-objects plan. I found this will skyrocket the complexity of the game. While it seems like it is an amazing feature, it will destroy my motivation to actually have fun. Maybe by continuing system implementation, I might find a good way to do it painlessly.
- The goal is shifted now to an archer game where the character is controlled by mouse. Basically, if you click on a non-enemy you will go there, if you click on an enemy, you will attack it.
- The game progression and mechanics will revolve around moves, different arrow types and bow/crossbow/sling/device-you-shoot-with which will have implications on the gameplay
- Currently not testing anything. The scope of the files changes so fast that testing will be a big hindrance towards my work. Once I have a solid foundation of the game I will properly test it. 
- Removed the research points section. I just don't do it. Waste of sheet space. I am much more hyped up to do actually do something!

TODOs For Next Update
------------------------
- For the love of God, comment the code or explain it somewhere so I can understand it if I forget what was I doing!!! 
- Log my work better on GitHub with issues
- Separate Action from States
- Create path finding system (Probably A*). Test it with a mod as well
- Create blocking and sequential animations (animations which must be performed before you can move, have to be done in a specific sequence)
- Use linked list instead of a vector for applying actions ( This is super trivia but I think it will improve performance. I am not sure how it will work with the point above)
- ?? Make world the executor of actions rather than action objects themselves ?? (This is difficult to access. I can foresee that interactions between objects will be very difficult if every object interacts with another this way. It is possible it might not be a problem but needs to be investigated for sure)
- Make the main character go where the mouse clicks.
