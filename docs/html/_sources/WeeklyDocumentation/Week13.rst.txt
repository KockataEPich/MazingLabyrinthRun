Week 13
==============================================

Date: 30/March/2022

Retrospect
------------------------
- A basic infrastructure has been put in place. There is a moving character on the screen with the camera following.
- It has been more difficult to know how to properly setup the project. I actually don't really know yet how to divide the types of classes.
- I am going to continue working and when I hit something that is obivously bad, I am going to refactor it.

Week Plan
------------------------
- Setup simple tilemap system
- Add a simple mob and make it move.

Research Points
-----------------
	1. React and browser code integrity in general
	2. Java Containers
	3. Procedural generation
	4. Electron (for the client)
	5. Tile based system
