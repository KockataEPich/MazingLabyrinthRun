Week 3
==============================================

Date: 06/December/2021

Retrospect
------------------------
- Because of work and life occupation, the scope of the project was not assessed
- It became apparent that it is too early to think about components and their interactions
- The project has been setup with the starters for both the backend and the front end with their respective initializers
- Work environment is now ready on both computers that are used to work on this project

Week Plan
------------------------
This week will be occupied by thinking more about the project itself. A very abstracted
diagram will be created on how the project will look like in my mind right now. After proper research
has been done a new diagram will be made to reflect the accumulated knowledge and the current ideas are.

Getting more educated on design patterns is also vital before starting the project which will
also be a focus this, and maybe also the following, week.

Research Points
-----------------
	1. Project Scope
	2. Design Patterns and their usage
	3. Appropriate diagram software
