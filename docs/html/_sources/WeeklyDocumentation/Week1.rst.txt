Week 1 
==============================================

Date: 22/November/2021

Retrospect
------------------------
There is no restrospect this week as this is the 
first entry.

Week Plan
------------------------
The overall plan for the upcoming week is to finalize the project setup
from version control standpoint and to do some reasearch on potential technologies.

As of now the intention is to build the game with
	* ReactJS - as front-end
	* JavaSpring - as back-end
	* MySQL - as database
	
Right now the database choice is not completely set in stone. 

Research Points
-----------------
	1. What is the most appropriate database for this project
	2. Do the choices for front-end and back-end fit with the project idea
	3. Scope of the project (i.e what should it actually include)
	4. Is this the most appropriate way to document the project?
	5. Aesthethics of the documentation (template, structure, etc)
