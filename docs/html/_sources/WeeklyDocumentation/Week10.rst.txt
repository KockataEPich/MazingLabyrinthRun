==============================================

Retrospect
------------------------
- I have tried rather hard to setup godot and work with it in C++. the main problem is that I am basically shooting myself in the foot if I do  that. Support for C++ development with Godot is actually not very good. I am unable to use many basic debugging features and the whole process is rather painful. It seems it is meant for optimizations of certain taxing small parts of the game. 

- Looking at the documentation, it is also kind of obvious that it is not very C++ friendly. Information on the web is lacking. It seems like it is not going to be  an enjoyable program experience. They feature a custom language for Godot, however one of the main goals of the project is to expand my C++ knowledge. Tutorials, for C++ godot are almost non-existent.

- I am finally settling on Unreal Engine for the game. This engine has always been on my mind, but I was avoiding it because I thought it would be an overkill. The game I am trying to make is not that complicated and this engine is rather big and has a very high learning curve. 

- I know that my goals are technically achievable. The engine has too much potential.
- There is a massive community around it. Tons of support materials, tutorials, documentations, stacks of data.

I guess it will be a journey.

Week Plan
