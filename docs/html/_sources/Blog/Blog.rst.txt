=====================================================

There is no real structure to this blog. It is mostly for me to
talk about my thoughts so that I can maybe find something useful in them.

It has been rather a difficult start, but that is to be expected. Right now I am 
struggling with:
	
	* Managing the project external files. I am not sure how to keep/reference them properly
	* Managing the complexity of the application. I want things to be clean, however it feels like if I try to do something, then there will be an explosion of classes, methods, etc... If the application is to be functional, I need to find a way to cleanly display these things
	* There seems to be a lot of math involved in the creation of these games, which I am familiar with as a concept and as a math equation, but not really in code terms. 

Right now, I am also not sure how the game is supposed to look like. I don't want it to be just a topdown look as in many other 2D games, where there is no perspective. I would really
want to be able to make the game appear to have depth. This involves very complicated calculations on what to draw first, what to draw last, which kind of scare me right now. 
Also, the game itself MUST be procedurely generated. I was considering making a level experience, in which levels are premade, but I am not a fan of this idea. The goal is to make
an experience which to some degree resembles "The Binding of Isaac", however in a different more RPG-ish style. It seems that I need to have a 2D world combined with a "camera" which
makes things feel as if they are 3d. 

In the begining, I was imagining that the game consists of only solving the labyrinth, but I thought about it a lot and I decided for it to be more dynamic (meaning include combat,
magic, enemies, etc). It felt like the original idea would have been too boring. I didn't imagine anyone would like to sit down for 2 hours to just hit walls. It didn't feel exciting. 
Another game which I would like to mix in is "Risk of Rain 2". I kind of want this feel, where while you are exploring the dungeon, you find powers, items, etc... which change the 
gameplay in some meaningful way. Reaching the end of the labyrinth should feel rewarding, and doing it as quick as possible should be used as a skill metric. 

Something else that worries me is that nowadays, games need to be slick in order for someone to want to play them. This means smooth animations, transitions, "feels responsive" kind of
experience. What mostly worries me is the art creation. It shouldn't be too difficult since I already paint/draw, but having creative design is very imporant and probably
many frames as well to create the smooth transitions.

Right now, I am not focusing on music/sound. That would be very far away in the future...

I am not sure whether the scope of the game has gone too large. I really have many ideas inside my head, but there are other things in my life I want to focus on. 
Still, most of the work I do here is to better my experience, so it can never be a problem. Even so, I am actually excited to work on this. I was feeling guilty that it took me
so long to actually start the development but it was worth it. I may not be using the latest technologies, but I wanted to have fun while doing it. There is a long journey ahead of me.
